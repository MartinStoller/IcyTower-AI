# IcyTower-AI
I trained an AI to play the original Icy Tower game with NEAT.
You can also find an introduction to my project as well as the learning progress over 60+ hours of training on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TvV-Z_cGA . However, this video was meant to be beginner freindly and entertaining, so I kept things basic there.

I trained a custom neural Net for the score detection with tesseract. This Neural Net is not uploaded here so you would have to do that by yourself if you want to use the uploaded code.

Even though I did not upload anything about it, it might be nice to know, that I also tried a supervised learning technique based on k-neighbore classifiers as well as a deep Q-learning approach. Both approaches preformed significantly worse.
