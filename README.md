# IcyTower-AI
I trained an AI to play the original Icy Tower game with NEAT.

Even though I did not upload anything about it, it might be nice to know, that I also tried a supervised learning technique based on k-neighbore classifiers as well as a deep Q-learning approach. Both approaches preformed significantly worse.
